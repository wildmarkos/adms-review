# Advanced Analytics Refactoring Plan: Data-Driven Decision Support System

## Executive Summary

After analyzing both previous plans alongside the actual survey questions, response data processing, and frontend implementation, I propose a data-driven decision support system that transforms the current analytics platform into an actionable business intelligence tool for the admissions process. This plan combines architectural improvements with data-validated metrics to create a truly useful analytics dashboard.

Rather than simply reporting metrics, this system will guide users toward specific actions, predict outcomes, and provide contextual decision support tailored to each stakeholder's role in the admissions process.

## 1. Current System Analysis

### 1.1 Technical Issues

- **Excessive Monolithic Structure**: Both API route (1398 lines) and frontend (1208 lines) are too large
- **Authentication Vulnerability**: Hardcoded password ("uniat") in frontend code
- **Data Transformation Inefficiency**: Multiple redundant calculations
- **Unclear Metric Definitions**: Many metrics lack clear methodologies for calculation
- **Poor Error Handling**: Minimal validation or error recovery
- **Missing Types**: Some interfaces are incomplete

### 1.2 Business Analytics Issues

- **Action-Insight Gap**: Metrics don't directly connect to specific actions
- **Role Confusion**: Metrics aren't tailored to specific user roles (managers vs. admissions staff)
- **Data Validity Concerns**: No confidence indicators for metrics with small sample sizes
- **Trend Analysis Weakness**: Limited historical tracking and prediction
- **Visual Information Overload**: Too many charts without clear hierarchy

### 1.3 Data Reality Assessment

Based on analysis of `src/lib/questions.ts` and `src/app/api/analytics/route.ts`, our data has specific strengths and limitations:

**Strong Data Areas:**
- Time allocation metrics (questions 57, 172, 248)
- System complexity measurements (questions 131, 141, 218, 290)
- Team collaboration (questions 322, 332, 342, 354)
- Personal productivity barriers (questions 407, 426)

**Limited Data Areas:**
- Lead funnel stage-by-stage conversion rates
- Detailed time-in-stage measurements
- ROI calculations for system improvements

## 2. Core Design Principles

The new analytics system will follow these principles:

1. **Action-Oriented**: Every metric leads to specific actions
2. **Role-Based**: Different views for different stakeholder roles
3. **Data-Validated**: Only show metrics with sufficient data quality
4. **Decision-Focused**: Organize around key decisions, not technical categories
5. **Context-Rich**: Provide benchmarks and trend context for every metric
6. **Visually Hierarchical**: Clear visual importance hierarchy
7. **Forward-Looking**: Predictive elements based on current trends

    score: number; // 0-1 scale
    sampleSize: number;
    dataSources: string[];
    lastUpdated: Date;
    factors: string[]; // what affects confidence
  };
  trend?: {
    direction: 'improving' | 'stable' | 'declining';
    velocity: number;
    sinceDate: Date;
  };
  benchmark?: {
    industry: number;
    internal: number;
    target: number;
  };
}
```

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Calculation Models

#### Time Allocation Analysis

```typescript
// Example of enhanced time allocation calculation
function calculateTimeAllocation(responses: SurveyResponse[]): TimeAllocationMetrics {
  // Extract data from questions 57, 172, 248
  const managerTimeData = extractPercentageData(responses, 57);
  const teamTimeData = extractPercentageData(responses, 172);
  const individualTimeData = extractPercentageData(responses, 248);
  
  // Weighted calculation based on role and response count
  const adminTime = weightedAverage([
    { value: getAdminTimeFromResponse(teamTimeData), weight: 2 },
    { value: getAdminTimeFromResponse(individualTimeData), weight: 1 }
  ]);
  
  const strategicTime = getStrategicTimeFromResponse(managerTimeData);
  const salesTime = getSalesTimeFromResponse(teamTimeData, individualTimeData);
  
  // Calculate efficiency scores
  const timeEfficiencyScore = calculateEfficiencyScore(adminTime, salesTime);
  const strategicFocusScore = calculateStrategicFocus(strategicTime);
  
  // Calculate potential impact of reallocation
  const potentialTimeGain = calculatePotentialGain(adminTime, salesTime);
  const recommendedActions = generateTimeRecommendations(adminTime, salesTime, strategicTime);
  
  return {
    distribution: {
      adminTime,
      salesTime,
      strategicTime,
      otherTime: 100 - (adminTime + salesTime + strategicTime)
    },
    scores: {
      timeEfficiency: timeEfficiencyScore,
      strategicFocus: strategicFocusScore
    },
    impact: {
      potentialTimeGain,
      revenueImpact: estimateRevenueImpact(potentialTimeGain, salesTime)
    },
    recommendations: recommendedActions,
    confidence: calculateConfidenceScore(responses.length, [57, 172, 248])
  };
}
```

#### System Complexity Impact

```typescript
function calculateSystemComplexityImpact(responses: SurveyResponse[]): SystemComplexityMetrics {
  // Extract data from questions 218, 131, 141, 290
  const toolCountData = extractMultipleChoiceData(responses, 218);
  const workaroundData = extractMultipleChoiceData(responses, 131);
  const criticalWorkaroundsData = extractTextData(responses, 141);
  const manualMethodsData = extractCheckboxData(responses, 290);
  
  // Calculate metrics
  const toolCount = estimateToolCount(toolCountData);
  const workaroundPrevalence = calculateWorkaroundPrevalence(workaroundData, manualMethodsData);
  const criticalWorkarounds = analyzeCriticalWorkarounds(criticalWorkaroundsData);
  
  // Impact calculations
  const trainingImpact = estimateTrainingImpact(toolCount);
  const dataIntegrityRisk = estimateDataIntegrityRisk(workaroundPrevalence, criticalWorkarounds);
  const timeWaste = estimateTimeWaste(toolCount, workaroundPrevalence);
  
  // Recommendations
  const toolConsolidationOptions = generateToolConsolidationOptions(toolCount, criticalWorkarounds);
  const automationOpportunities = identifyAutomationOpportunities(criticalWorkarounds);
  
  return {
    metrics: {
      toolCount,
      workaroundPrevalence,
      criticalWorkarounds: criticalWorkarounds.length,
      complexityScore: calculateComplexityScore(toolCount, workaroundPrevalence)
    },
    impact: {
      trainingImpact,
      dataIntegrityRisk,
      timeWaste
    },
    recommendations: {
      toolConsolidationOptions,
      automationOpportunities,
      prioritizedActions: prioritizeActions(trainingImpact, dataIntegrityRisk, timeWaste)
    },
    confidence: calculateConfidenceScore(responses.length, [218, 131, 141, 290])
  };
}
```

### 5.3 Decision Support Algorithm

The system will use a multi-factor decision support algorithm that:

1. Identifies critical issues using severity + frequency + impact
2. Calculates ROI for potential improvements
3. Estimates implementation difficulty
4. Considers interdependencies between issues
5. Provides specific, actionable recommendations

```typescript
function generateDecisionSupport(
  metrics: AllMetrics,
  userRole: 'manager' | 'operations' | 'executive'
): DecisionSupportPackage {
  // Filter relevant metrics by role
  const relevantMetrics = filterMetricsByRole(metrics, userRole);
  
  // Identify critical issues
  const criticalIssues = identifyCriticalIssues(relevantMetrics);
  
  // Calculate improvement opportunities
  const improvements = calculateImprovementOpportunities(relevantMetrics);
  
  // Rank by ROI
  const rankedImprovements = rankByROI(improvements);
  
  // Generate specific action steps
  const actionPlans = generateActionPlans(rankedImprovements, userRole);
  
  // Create visualizations
  const visualizations = createDecisionVisualizations(rankedImprovements, criticalIssues);
  
  return {
    criticalIssues,
    prioritizedImprovements: rankedImprovements.slice(0, 5),
    recommendedActions: actionPlans,
    potentialOutcomes: predictOutcomes(rankedImprovements.slice(0, 3)),
    visualizations
  };
}
```

## 6. Advanced Visualization Components

### 6.1 Interactive Decision Trees

For complex decisions, the system will provide interactive decision trees that guide users through options:

```jsx
<DecisionTree
  initialQuestion="What aspect of the admissions process do you want to improve?"
  branches={[
    {
      option: "Time efficiency",
      nextQuestion: "Which role's time is most constrained?",
      branches: [
        {
          option: "Managers",
          recommendation: {
            title: "Optimize Manager Time Allocation",
            steps: [
              "Reduce system oversight time by implementing automated monitoring",
              "Delegate administrative approvals where appropriate",
              "Create templates for common feedback scenarios"
            ],
            metrics: {
              currentManagerAdminTime: `${data.timeAllocation.adminTime.toFixed(0)}%`,
              potentialImprovement: "15-20% reduction",
              estimatedImpact: "3 hours/week per manager"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          option: "Sales team",
          recommendation: {...}
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      option: "Lead conversion rate",
      nextQuestion: "At which stage are you losing most leads?",
      branches: [...]
    }
  ]}
/>
```

### 6.2 Impact Simulators

Allow users to simulate changes and see potential impacts:

```jsx
<ImpactSimulator
  metric="adminTimePercentage"
  currentValue={data.timeAllocation.adminTime}
  range={[0, 100]}
  step={5}
  impactFormula={(newValue) => ({
    salesTimeGain: data.timeAllocation.adminTime - newValue,
    revenueImpact: calculateRevenueImpact(data.timeAllocation.adminTime - newValue),
    implementationEffort: calculateEffortLevel(data.timeAllocation.adminTime, newValue)
  })}
  recommendations={[
    { threshold: 15, text: "Excellent balance" },
    { threshold: 30, text: "Good balance" },
    { threshold: 45, text: "Needs improvement" },
    { threshold: 100, text: "Critical issue" }
  ]}
/>
```

### 6.3 Contextual Metric Cards

Each metric will be displayed with full context:

```jsx
<ContextualMetricCard
  title="Admin vs. Sales Time"
  value={`${data.timeAllocation.adminTime.toFixed(0)}%`}
  trend={{
    direction: data.timeAllocation.adminTime > previousData.timeAllocation.adminTime ? "up" : "down",
    change: Math.abs(data.timeAllocation.adminTime - previousData.timeAllocation.adminTime).toFixed(1),
    isPositive: data.timeAllocation.adminTime < previousData.timeAllocation.adminTime
  }}
  benchmark={{
    industry: 25,
    target: 20,
    current: data.timeAllocation.adminTime
  }}
  confidence={{
    score: calculateConfidence(data.timeAllocation.sampleSize),
    label: data.timeAllocation.sampleSize > 15 ? "High" : data.timeAllocation.sampleSize > 5 ? "Medium" : "Low"
  }}
  impact="Each 5% reduction in admin time yields approximately 2 additional sales hours per person per week"
  recommendation={data.timeAllocation.adminTime > 30 ? 
    "Consider automation for repetitive administrative tasks" : 
    "Current admin time allocation is healthy"
  }
  dataSource="Questions 172, 248 (Time Allocation Survey)"
/>
```
