# Eduscore Feedback System - Project Overview

## Executive Summary

This project designs a comprehensive feedback system for an admissions team using Eduscore CRM platform. The system addresses critical pain points including lead tracking inefficiencies, data entry burdens, poor metrics accessibility, and team members reverting to Excel for workarounds.

## Problem Statement

**Current Challenges:**
- Lead tracking and follow-up inefficiencies (prospects falling through cracks)
- Data entry and reporting burdens taking time away from sales activities
- Poor lead quality or conversion rates at specific stages
- Communication gaps between managers and sales team
- Metrics are difficult to access, causing reversion to Excel

**Team Context:**
- Medium-sized team (15-30 people)
- 4-6 managers and 20-25 sales representatives
- Medium sales cycle (1-3 months): lead generation → qualification → multiple consultations → application → enrollment

## Solution Approach

The feedback system employs multiple proven methodologies:

1. **Kirkpatrick Model** - Evaluating system effectiveness at reaction, learning, behavior, and results levels
2. **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** - Adapted for internal tool satisfaction
3. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** - Using fishbone diagrams and 5-why technique
4. **Workflow Mapping** - To identify process bottlenecks
5. **Performance Analytics Framework** - Correlating feedback with enrollment outcomes

## Key Components

1. **Dual Questionnaire System**
   - Manager questionnaire (strategic focus)
   - Sales team questionnaire (tactical focus)

2. **Technical Architecture**
   - Web-based survey interface
   - SQLite database for local storage
   - Advanced analytics engine
   - Real-time dashboard and reporting

3. **Implementation Plan**
   - 8-week phased rollout
   - Pilot testing and optimization
   - Training and change management

## Expected Outcomes

- Identify specific areas for Eduscore improvement
- Reduce reliance on Excel workarounds
- Improve lead conversion rates
- Enhance team productivity and satisfaction
- Create data-driven action plans for enrollment growth

## Document Structure

This project is documented in four focused files:

1. **01-questionnaire-design.md** - Detailed questionnaires for managers and sales team
2. **02-technical-architecture.md** - System design, database schema, and technical specifications
3. **03-implementation-plan.md** - Phased rollout plan, timelines, and success metrics
4. **00-project-overview.md** - This executive summary and project context

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve questionnaire design
2. Validate technical architecture approach
3. Confirm implementation timeline and resources
4. Switch to implementation mode for development
